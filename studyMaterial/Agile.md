**Concepts of interest**

**Framework**

A framework is a structure of work, designed to optimize the developing processes.It gathers together concepts and practices to solve a particular problem, that will work as a reference to solve new ones with similar nature. 

**Agile Methodologies**

Agile methodologies were popularized by the *Manifesto for Agile Software Development.* Their main purpose is to reinforce the collaborative effort of self organizing and the synergy of a cross functional team, where all the parts work together toward a common goal. Continual improvement and having a flexible response to change are key when it comes to agile.

**Scrum**

**What is Scrum?**

Scrum is a framework, whose goal is to help you get the work done.It uses an agile mindset for its process, that helps to generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems. 
It's the "Divide and Conquer" we all know, but with some guides that will help you make a more optimal and adaptive conquest.  

**Scrum Pillars**

The three pillars of Scrum are Transparency, Inspection and Adaptation. Let's briefly go through them to better understand what we are talking about.

Transparency : Both the team performing the work, and those receiving the work, should be aware of the complete process. High transparency allows to reduce risk and increase value. It also enables inspection. 

Inspection:  A frequent inspection is needed to detect potentially undesirable problems.It allows adaptation.

Adaptation:  If the resulting product is not acceptable, or any aspect starts to deviate outside the acceptable standard, it should be adjusted as soon as possible. At the moment the team learns something new through inspection, they are expected to adapt it to the project.

**Scrum Events**

Scrum combines four formal events that implement the three pillars of the framework. The Sprint is a container for all of them: Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective.

The events are used to optimize the working process, this means creating regularity, and minimizing unnecessary meetings. If possible, all events should be held at the same time and place to reduce complexity.

Sprint:  They are fixed length events, as tops a month long, and they are meant to create consistency. It's where all happens. As mentioned in the Scrum Guide "where ideas are turned into value". (Schwaber & Jeff Sutherland, 2020)

A new Sprint starts right after the other.Some important points to have in mind:

- No changes are made that could endanger the main goal.
- Quality does not decrease.
- Product Backlog is improved as needed.
- Project reach may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as it advances.

Each Sprint should be considered as a short project, where risk and costs are reduced to a and its allow to generate more learning cycles in a short period of time.If the main goal becomes obsolete, the Sprint could be cancelled. Only the Product Owner has the authority to do this.

Sprint Planning:  is a plan created by the collaboration of the entire Scrum Team. 
It addresses the following points:

- Why is this sprint valuable?
- What can be done on this Sprint?
- How will the work get done?

Daily Scrum: is a 15 minute meeting for the developers of the Scrum Team. The main purpose is to have a regular checking of the progress toward the main goal and adapt it if necessary. It also helps with communication, quick decision making and self management.

Sprint Review: It's a working session that should not be limited to a presentation.The main purpose is to study the outcome of the Sprint, and decide if it needs further adaptations. 

Sprint Retrospective: This stage is meant to plan how to improve the process. The team evaluates the interactions, effectiveness, and tools used on the last Sprint.Together with feedback, they inspect what went well, and how they solved the encountered issues. With this event, the Sprint is concluded.



**Scrum Artifacts**

The artefacts are tools that will help you guide your work, it ensures everybody is on the same page.

**Product Backlog - Product Goal**

The Product Backlog is directly linked to the Product Goal, its an ordered list of how to improve the project and what to do in order to fulfill the Product Goal. The items with highest priority goes first, so the team knows how to organize the deadlines.The long term objective of the Scrum Team is the Product Goal, it's needed to complete or abandon one objective before taking the next one. 

**Sprint Backlog - Sprint Goal**

Similar to the Product Backlog, the Sprint Backlog is a plan to achieve the Sprint Goal. It is updated throughout the Sprint, and it works as a tool to organize the work and to keep focus on the objective. 

**Increment - Definition of Done**

The Increment is the usable product that results from a Sprint, however it directly depends on the Definition of Done that the whole team has defined. Multiple Increments can be created within a Sprint, and they are means to the Product Goal



**Scrum Roles**

The Scrum Team consists of a unit of professionals focused on one objective (Product Goal). In general there is a group of 10 people or less, in order to enhance communication and proactiveness. The roles within this team are the Developers, the Product Owner and the Scrum Master.

Developers: They are the developers and designers that do the daily work in order to accomplish the Sprint Goals. They are also responsible for analyzing how to improve the work practises. 

Product Owners: Their main job is to bring the product vision to life, they are the link between the customers and the team, so they can help to prioritize the work the development team will do.

Scrum Master: Are the experts within the team, their main job is to coach Developers and Product Owners, also to adjust the processes to improve their practises.
